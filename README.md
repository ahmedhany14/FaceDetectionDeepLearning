## Description

This project focuses on building a deep learning model for face detection in images. The model is trained to identify and localize human faces in different 
environments, including crowded spaces, varied lighting conditions, and different orientations. The face detection task is a crucial first step in applications like facial recognition, emotion detection, and more.


## What you will learn?!

- How to collect a data
- How to label the images if it is not labeled
- Apply data augmentations on the images
- Use a deep transfer learning model (VGG16)


## Packages and frameworks i used

- [Python 3.x]()
- [numpy](https://keras.io/) for Algebra
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) for datasets
- [cv2](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html) For images
- [keras](https://keras.io/) for Neural Networks
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for Neural Networks
- [Albumentations](https://albumentations.ai/) for data augmentations
- [Labelme](https://github.com/labelmeai/labelme) For labeling the data
